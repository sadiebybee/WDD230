                    In design, repetition means reusing elements — colors, patterns, fonts, images, 
                    textures and more — throughout a piece of work. Another way of thinking about 
                    repetition is consistency. It can be used to create a sense of familiarity, 
                    consistency, and identity. Examples of how repetition helps users include: helping 
                    them find what they are looking for, feel comfortable, and remember the brand.
                </p>

                    Shopify uses repetition in its design to provide a consistent user experience 
                    for its merchants and their customers. The admin dashboard, where merchants manage their 
                    stores, uses a consistent layout and design language, making it easy for users to navigate 
                    and use the platform. For customers shopping on Shopify-powered stores, the consistent use 
                    of product listing formats, navigation elements, and checkout processes ensures a smooth and 
                    efficient shopping experience.

                    White space is the blank areas in a design, also known as negative space, and clean design is 
                    a philosophy that emphasizes simplicity and clarity. Both are important in web design because 
                    they can improve the user experience. White space can be used to separate and group elements, 
                    and to provide breathing room around text and images. It can also be used to create a focal 
                    point by giving space around a particular element.

                    Airbnb uses white space to emphasize their brands messaging. White space is also used to create 
                    a simple, user-friendly experience for its users. They use white space to create a sense of clarity 
                    and simplicity. Airbnb's design is minimal and uses white space to establish the overall structure and 
                    balance of their design. Airbnb's design is designed to make the property listing and booking 
                    process as easy and straightforward as possible.

                <p>Proximity specifically relates to arranging related elements close to each other to emphasize 
                    their connection. This principle ensures that content, objects, or text are logically organized, 
                    facilitating clear communication and a visually pleasing composition.</p>
                <p>
                    Trello uses hierarchy and the law of proximity to display the most important information at the
                    top of the screen. Trello uses the law of proximityin its design to create a visual interface 
                    that's easy to use. The most important information, like the board name and card lists, is displayed
                    prominently. Less important information are organized in logical groupings underneath.
