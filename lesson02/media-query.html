            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; 
                and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, 
                and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>

            <h2>Alma 32:21</h2>
            <p>And now as I said concerning faithâ€”faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; 
                therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.</p>
